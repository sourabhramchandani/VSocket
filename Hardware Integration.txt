Hardware Integration

	Step1- We’ll have to connect the NodeMCU with the Relay board, you can choose to do it with a bread board or without. But I prefer doing it using a Breadboard.

	Step2- Connect the D3 pin of NodeMCU with Pin 1 of Relay. Similarly connect D4 pin of NodeMCU with Relay pin 2, D5 with Relay 3 and D6 with Relay 4.

	Step3- Connect Ground Pin of Relay with Ground Pin of NodeMCU.

	Step4- Now to power up the NodeMCU you can use a normal phone charger, just make sure its voltage is not too high. And to power up the Relay board, you can use a battery or a separate breadboard power 	              supplier.

	Step5- As we are using a four-channel relay you can connect at most 4 electronic appliances to the Relay and control them over the internet.

Now if you want to connect your household appliances like Fan, Lights etc. which are connected to the main power of your house.

Note:- While connecting household appliances turn off electricity of house from electric meter or take help of electrician.
